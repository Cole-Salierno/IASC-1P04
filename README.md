# Edge of the World by Cole Salierno
# IASC-1P04

In Edge of the World, you the player are taking a well deserved summer vacation to a remote cottage. While you spend 3 days here you discover things about the world around you that seem slightly strange to you. But to a regular person, well they would'nt notice a thing. Inspired by my summer vacation during 2021 and "Gravity Falls". Edge of the World conveys that looking closer at everyday life and living in the moment instead of the past/future is how you discover life and live it to the fullest.
